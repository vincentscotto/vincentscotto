We recognized your efforts leading up to the IDZ launch previously, but we also want to say thank you for the excellent results you’ve continued to deliver since the IDZ launch.
        <p>Your customers highly appreciate it and we do too! Thank you – it’s been amazing to watch you practice your craft! - <em>Deren, Andrew and Scott on behalf of IDZ stakeholders and DPO staff</em></p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>IDZ IoT website redesign - For restructuring the website and content to align with the IoT competitive strategy in time for IDF</p>

        <p>You are the recipient of the DRD-BPI Business Innovation “Buzz Lightyear Award” - for performing to infinity and beyond.</p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>This is very late in sending. Thank YOU for helping with the redesign of the Developer Product Division's "Product Update" email template earlier this year, and completing the html coding. This new email provided a much needed refreshed look and increased our branding affinity with Intel. Since it launched in September, many compliments were received on the improved design. We so appreciate your expertise and willingness to help. Thank YOU so very much. - <em>Brenda Christoffer</em></p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>Recognition for your wonderful efforts to deliver a RealSense / Tencent customized landing page supporting Tencent’s RealSense add-on with less than 24 hours of notice.  Amazing responsiveness combined with great results and customer orientation!</p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>WOW!!!!  I want to thank all 114 of you for an absolutely fantastic job on getting the Intel Atom Apps Store launched at my IDF keynote. When I think back that it was only 82 days ago that we said “hey, lets try to pull this idea off for IDF” and then did it with 3 OEM’s and 2 run time announcements, and multiple ISV’s all in support, I am blown away by what you accomplished. It was Intel at it’s best. I know that many of you had no sleep for the last couple of months and I want to thank you and your families for helping put Intel center stage in apps software! - <em>Paul O'tellini (Former Intel CEO)</em></p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>Excellent job of updating Intel's GDC 2013 page quickly and efficiently. You managed to handle both the time critical aspects of some changes and the minute details of others. The end result is the *BEST* Intel GDC page ever! You were very responsive to shifting requirements and consistently showed a willingness to work with me on prototype ideas that made it much easier for me to pull the page together. It was a pleasure to work with you</p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>Thanks Vincent for getting out the Ivy Bridge updates for the Ultrabook Community. It was a late request and you turned it around, which allowed us to capitalize on buzz to bring people to our Community page. Thanks for be results oriented and helping us achieve success.</p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>Thank you IDZ team for a fantastic job and superb response in getting the Intel Collaboration Service for WebRTC website and forum, up and ready in such a short notice. We appreciate your dedication and long hours getting the sites ready and helping us make our v1.0 release such a successful launch! – <em>Elmer Amaya</em></p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>Thank you all for your work on the IoT revamp on maker and IDZ. That was an absolute ton of work to do in the time frame we accomplished it in, and that wouldn't have happened without outstanding cross group collaboration, as well as just biting down and plowing through things. I know our stakeholders are appreciative of the effort, and I think that this collaboration can act as a model for cross group collaborations in the future. Thank you all for your hard work on this!</p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>Thank you Vincent for the continuous support and prompt turnaround of changes requested by VC Source stakeholders. Our stakeholder have a hard time visualizing changes outside of the website and your willingness to mock them up and continuously refine draft pages has made it a lot easier to obtain buy off and approval. This type of customer orientation and responsiveness is truly appreciated and has helped to keep our beta schedule and deliverables on track with high quality and happy stakeholders.</p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>I probably owe you a few of these. Thanks for all the hard work to get our templates more flexible and create better user experiences!</p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>Thanks for your hard work getting the localized Chinese Data Center Manager microsite up and running on ISN, and taking the initiative to work with DCM localization resources on encoding issues.</p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>Congratulations and thank you for your effort and focus on delivering our HTML5 Zone on Intel Developer Zone! The HTML5 Zone is the first time we’ve used IDZ to deliver DPD tools in an integrated web based IDE model, making it possible for developers to create, debug, and simulate HTML5 apps, all within the IDZ experience. You helped make it happen.</p></div>

        <div class="recognition"><p>I would like to thank Vincent for acting with urgency on delivering the Portable Class Library source code sample and article published on IDZ in a few hours notice right in time for publishing for MWC. Thanks Vincent! I greatly appreciate your very timely efforts.</p></div>

        <!-- <div class="recognition"><p>Vincent, I rated you Exceeds Expectations for 2015, and you are being promoted to a Grade 6. You had another fantastic year, and it’s been a pleasure watching you grow from your WebOps role and transform into a capable front-end developer over the past few years.
